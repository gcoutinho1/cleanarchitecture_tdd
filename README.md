if you are interested in watching this course, please check this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjE2IDphA_U&list=PLB6lc7nQ1n4iYGE_khpXRdJkJEp9WOech&index=1&ab_channel=ResoCoder).  

as the course was recorded in 2019 and at that time dart did not have **null-safety** some things you will need to do in a different way if you are using the **Dart** version ```>=2.12``` ```&&``` **Flutter** ```>= 2.0```.

For example when making class mocks for **unit tests** you will need to read this documentation here: [Mockito null-safety](https://github.com/dart-lang/mockito/blob/master/NULL_SAFETY_README.md)
